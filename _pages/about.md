This is the front page of the Bibliographies Project that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. The project was initially started by GnomeyGustav on Reddit, and was taken over by the Chief Librarian #001, and is currently and actively maintainted. Please visit our Github, and Webpage Wiki in order to find out more about the technicalities of the project. 

The Project
======
The Bibliographies Project is hosted both on Github, Github Pages (this current site) and Reddit. The goal of this project is to faciliate the recommendation of academic sources under rigourous standards in order for students of all calibers to study S.T.E.M. + L.A.S. fields. Each field is taken under consideration first by academic institution offerings, and it's validity as a field; new fields with very little impact upon the origin field will not be listed for a time in order to ascertain its impact. The toolbar above should help the end user find their fields and their publications. 


Getting started
======
For S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) each group is dividied by either being a "soft science", (Psychology, Sociology, Political Science), and "hard science", (Physics, Chemistry, Biology). Each Publication will have at least, a textbook, lecture notes, videos/lectures, assignments, and a list of thier pre-requisites and thier applicable fields.

Each publication may or may not be divided by it's undergraduate, or graduate listings, as well as it's markdown and LaTeX files. 

Publishing
=====

Each Publication will have a LaTeX file, as well as an open-source Markdown file on the Github. Each publication goes through four rounds (currently) of Quality Assurance and Control. Further notes can be found in the Wiki of either the Github and these Pages. 

Any user that may want to publish should contact the Chief Librarian for further information.
